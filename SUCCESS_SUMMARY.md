## 🔐 CRITICAL REMINDERS

### ⚠️ BACKUP KEYSTORE NOW!

You have **1 backup** at `~/RacketRescue-Keystore-Backup/`

**You need at least 2 more backups:**

\`\`\`bash
# Create encrypted backup
cd ~/RacketRescue-Keystore-Backup
zip -e racket-rescue-keystore-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).zip *.keystore *.txt
# Enter strong password

# Then upload to:
# 1. Dropbox/Google Drive
# 2. External hard drive
# 3. Password manager
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:**
- Without keystore, you CANNOT update the Android app
- If lost, must create NEW app listing (lose all users/reviews)
- This is the MOST CRITICAL file for your app
